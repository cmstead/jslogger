jslogger
========

Javascript console abstraction - Keeps logging to a minimum in a production environment

##Roadmap

- Add debug function at log level 3
- Move trace to log level 4 (It's verbose and potentially even more annoying than debug)
- Add expanded console support for modern API support

##Update log

###v1.1.1

- Fixed log level check. Regex was failing in a production environment
